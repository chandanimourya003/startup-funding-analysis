🚀 Startup Funding Analysis
Hey there! 👋
This is a little project I worked on to explore and analyze startup funding data using Python. The goal was to uncover trends like which sectors get the most funding, who the top investors are, and how investments vary across countries and over the years.

📦 Dataset Used
The data comes from Crunchbase and includes:

funding_rounds.csv
investments.csv
people.csv
relationships.csv
objects.csv
(You can find this dataset on Kaggle!)

🔍 What I Explored
Here’s what I analyzed and visualized:

Top funded sectors – Which industries got the most money 💰

Most active individual investors – Who’s investing the most

Funding round types – Seed, Series A, B... what’s trending?

Deals per year – How startup funding has changed over time

Funding by country – Which countries are leading the way

I also built a summary dashboard using bar charts in Matplotlib to bring all the insights together.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
